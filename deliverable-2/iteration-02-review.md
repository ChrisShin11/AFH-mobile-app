Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

    When: Nov 2, 2021
    Where: Myhal, in person meeting

Process - Reflection

Q1. Decisions that turned out well

    1. We‘ve decided to use Messenger in order to contact each other to get immediate responses, in addition to Messenger we used Discord for weekly online meetings in which we streamed our screens in order to discuss the meeting topics, group tasks and review each other's code easier. This worked very well because we were responsive and updated each other in real-time, whereas in discord, it was easier to keep track of our discussion results.

    2. We created a to-do list on notion in which we;
        - Ranked tasks by urgency and complexity
        - Separated the tasks by functionality and assigned them to group members so people didn’t have wait on each other to start on their tasks
        - Assigned the tasks according to everyone’s weekly workload in order to keep up our group’s progress at the times when group members have really busy weeks
        - Posted the notes taken from our weekly meetings on Notion.

    3. We let each other know about problems regarding busy weeks and personal problems in order to manage our progress as a group to divide tasks more fairly. This helped us to create both a more open environment for our group members to discuss problems that might arise and prevented any surprises happening that might affect our project negatively.

    4. We met frequently (3 times each week), and even if one person didn’t make any progress yet, they would still give and get an update from other group members.

Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

    1. Three meetings that we set up at the start of the term changed to one online meeting and one in-person meeting each week, mainly due to busy schedules for both teammates and the partner.

    2. We underestimated how long it would take us to fix the website’s bug, and planned our tasks inadequately which resulted in our team wasting a lot of our time to fix bugs for a code that was hardcoded and fragile.

    3. We divided the workload of the mobile app, screen by screen but this made it so that everyone in our team basically learned the same things regarding creating screens of the mobile app.

Q3. Planned changes

    1. Resolution for #1 [Q2]: Three meetings each week was a bit redundant, and hard to coordinate with six people’s schedule. We decided that we should split our group into pairs, and have one weekly meeting where we come together and give updates. Working in pairs is much easier to coordinate, and enhance the efficiency of the team.

    2. Resolution for #2 [Q2]: We are planning to do pair programming so that we don’t only rely on one person to work on the bug fixes.

    3. Resolution for #3 [Q2]: We are planning to divide the tasks more by roles, and have each person focus on a specific component. So someone would have more knowledge of databases, someone else would be better in front-end programming, etc…

Product - Review

Q4. How was your product demo?

    How did you prepare your demo?
        - We recorded sample use of our app, and we showed it to our partner. In the demo, we made sure to include sound as well. We used iMovie to edit it.

    What did you manage to demo to your partner?
        - In our demo, we showed playing the track (playing music), using the pomodoro, creating a todo list, the download self-care package page, the sound page, the starred track page (can save favorite songs/tracks) and general navigation of our app. Also, we deployed it on expo so he can test/use it from his end as well.

    Did your partner accept the features?
        - Our partner was happy with the product and accepted our features. He arranged a meeting so we can go over some potential new functionalities that he would be interested in having.

    Were there change requests?
        - No change requests, but potentially in terms of the design.

    What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
        - I think we learned that it’s very important to know who we are showing the demo to, what they know and don’t know yet. It’s tempting to show it as “we did this and that”, but after reviewing we thought the focus should be put on the user of the app, so we ended up showing the demo from a “as an user of the app” perspective.
